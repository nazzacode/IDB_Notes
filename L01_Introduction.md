## Database Management System (DBMS) Advantages
  - Uniform data administration
  - Efficient access to resources
  - Data independence
  - Reduced application development time 
  - Data integrity and security
  - Concurrent access
  - Recovery from crashes

## Database Kinds
  - Relational databases (course focus)
  - Document stores

## Relational Model
First proposed by Edgar F. Codd, 1970

### Schema
A relational model has a __schema__ consisting of

  - set of table names 
  - column names

## Query Languages
__Procedural__ Specify a _sequence of steps_ to obtain expected results.\
__Declarative__ Specify _what_ you want not _how_ to get it.

  - queries are typically declarative (the how is internal).
